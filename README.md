## 📌 Objective
The primary objective of this case study is to analyze customer behavior at a restaurant using SQL. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help the marketing and growth teams in improving customer engagement, retention, and acquisition strategies. This project focuses on understanding acquisition channels, ordering patterns, and promo effectiveness using real-world business questions.

## 📊 Project Description
In this SQL case study, we explore customer and order data from a restaurant to answer key business questions related to acquisition, order trends, and promotional impact. By writing optimized SQL queries, we generate insights that can support decision-making across marketing, growth, and operations teams.

This project includes the solution to the following analytical questions:

## ✅ Business Questions Solved
